TO\ DO in code
Some kind of visual for poke mode
Slider for changing constants ? such as attraction constant ( 20.f )


** Dependencies **
------------------
SFML

----------

This is a simulation of how charged particles ( that go through eachother & have slight constraints )
would act / interact in a torus based space

One can add points by having ADD selected ( with selected velocity, charge, and mass ), Delete
by having DEL selected and clicking a point, & create a "sudo point" ( one that isnt visible but
exists where the person is clicking -- has charge specified ) by having POKE selected.

There is a way to pause ( can ADD & DEL while paused ) & view fps

Selecting RND on any of the property blocks will generate a new random number each frame, thus
allowing one to enter points with randomized properties

The color of a point is based on charge ( red -- negative & blue -- positive ) & the more brightly
colored the more polar the charge
The size of a point is based on mass & the radius is proportional to 5 * mass ( in pixels )
