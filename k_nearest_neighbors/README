*   K-Nearest Neighbors Visualizer by Brandon Roberts
*   Version 1.0 Update : Release!

**********************************************************

** Contains **
--------------
k_nearest_neighbors/k-nearest.cpp ( w/ int main() )
k_nearest_neighbors/k_nearest_functions.h ( & .cpp )
k_nearest_gui/k_nearest_gui.h ( & .cpp )


** Issues **
------------
No known issues

Many implicit conversion & comparison warnings generated with clang++ -Weverything, but these are all
safe based on constrains in code ( however still fix these at some point, key : Change undo_pos to 
size_t of some iterator type )

Check out vtable warning, dont fully understand this as of now : -Wweak-vtables


** Ideas **
-----------
TO\ DO in code
Implement full labeling system


** Dependencies **
------------------
SFML
X11 (Xinitthreads)
Harmony SFML lib


** Compiling **
---------------

  make

ie. C++17 & uses Harmony's libharmony-sfml.a
NOTE : Change -I directory to location of Harmony dir & Change -L directory to inside Harmony dir


** READ **
----------

This is a visualization application, which demonstrates the k nearest neighbors to a selected point

One can add points by having ADD selected, Delete by having DEL selected, Clear by pressing CLR,
Select a new point with SEL active, & Undo / Redo additions, deletions, and clears with resp. buttons

Neighbors indicates how many of the nearest neighbors to selected point will be in radius

INT mode uses a visual grid & city block metric for distances
FLOAT mode used a sort of graph area 0-10 and Euclidean (L2) norm for distances
