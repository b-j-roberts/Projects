This is a visualization application, which demonstrates the k nearest neighbors to a selected point

One can add points by having ADD selected, Delete by having DEL selected, Clear by pressing CLR,
Select a new point with SEL active, & Undo / Redo additions, deletions, and clears with resp. buttons

Neighbors indicates how many of the nearest neighbors to selected point will be in radius

INT mode uses a visual grid & city block metric for distances
FLOAT mode used a sort of graph area 0-10 and Euclidean (L2) norm for distances
