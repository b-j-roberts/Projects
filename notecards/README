This is a flashcard study platform that takes a file as input & loads a deck of flashcards from it
Flashcards can have arbitrarily many faces & there can be arbitrarily many flashcards

Progress bar displayed on bottom of screen

TO USE :
  ./notecards -f <notecards file path>

  in <notecards file path>:
    
    card1 face1,card1 face2,card1 face3, ...
    card2 face1,card2 face2,card2 face3, ...
    .
    .
    .

  NOTE: The notecards file is loaded into a wstring so any character type should work ( UTF8 )

Interface:
  FLIP - flips card face
  NEXT - goes to next card
  REM - removes card from deck
  RESET - resets deck to original state on load ( put all cards back )
