Find the number of ways to go from top left to bottom right of 20x20 grid, with R and D moves.\\
Obviously have to make 40 moves total (20 R and 20 D) no matter what. So if we look at the number of rearrangements of 40 objects that are 2 sets of 20 of the same thing we have $40!/(20!\cdot 20!)$.\\
Solution: 137846528820.
