Find the largest prime divisor of 600851475143. Starting from the lowest prime 2, we check if 2 divides our number. It does not. We go to the next prime and check it. We repeat this till we find a prime dividing our number and store that as the max prime and divide out all factors of that prime from our number thus lowering our range of primes to check. Repeating this until we are left with the largest prime dividing our number gives the solution.\\
Solution: 6857
