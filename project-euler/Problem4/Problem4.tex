Find the largest palindrome, which is the product of 2 three digit numbers. This was a simple double for loop which looped through all two 3 digit number combinations, multiplied them, check if its a palindrome, and then store if its larger than any of the previously checked palindromes. We were able to check less possibilities by indexing the 2nd set based on the 1st to represent the commutitive property of integers.\\
Solution: 906609
