With inspiration from the equation:
\begin{equation}
d(n)=\prod_{p} (e_1+1)\dots(e_k+1)
\end{equation}
st $d(n)$ is the divisor function and $n=\prod_{p} p^{e_p}$ with k prime divisors.\\
We know that we can decrease the size of our loop by decreasing the upper bound whenever a divisor was found, this shortened the code execution to give the valid solution.\\
Solution:76576500.
